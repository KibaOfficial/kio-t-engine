# Kio T Engine

Kio T Engine is a lightweight 2D game engine written in TypeScript, focused on creating browser-based games with only using the web API. The engine features essential systems like input management, delta time for frame-independent updates, window resizing, and a simple pause system.

## Features

- **DeltaTime Management:** Keeps the game running at a consistent speed across different devices.
- **Input Management:** Handles keyboard events, including a built-in pause toggle.
- **Window Management:** Automatically resizes the game canvas when the window is resized.
- **Pause System:** Displays a built-in pause overlay when the game is paused.
- **Custom Graphics (coming soon):** Includes functions for rendering graphics on the canvas.
  and much more in the future.
